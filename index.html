  <h2>Without A Song</h2>
  <h4>(Medaglia d’Oro — Serena’s Cat, by Storm Cat)</h4>

  <p><strong>Without A Song</strong>, a striking son of <em>Medaglia d’Oro</em> and out of <em>Serena’s Cat</em> by <em>Storm Cat</em>, represents the union of two legendary bloodlines. His sire contributes proven class, stamina, and versatility, while his dam adds the brilliance, speed, and toughness that define the Storm Cat legacy.</p>

  <p>Bred on a pedigree of performance, <strong>Without A Song</strong> offers balance, athleticism, and scope — the kind of cross that works beautifully with Northern Dancer, Mr. Prospector, and Storm Cat families. His foals are bred to carry the same competitive spirit and quality, built to perform from sprint to classic distances on both dirt and turf.</p>

  <p>Earner of nearly <strong>$90,000</strong>, Broken Proposal brings substance and class from one of North America’s most versatile sire lines.

  <p>This match blends Medaglia d’Oro’s stamina and scope with Broken Vow’s durability and tactical speed. The resulting foals are expected to carry athletic balance, trainable minds, and commercial appeal.</p>

    <p><strong>Hazy Storm</strong> is a beautifully bred Thoroughbred mare combining the elite speed influence of
      <em>Storm Cat</em> with the stamina and class of <em>Northern Dancer</em>.</p>

    <p>Her sire, <strong>Category Five</strong>, was a winning, stakes-siring son of Storm Cat and the
      <strong>Leading Thoroughbred Sire in North Dakota</strong> for three consecutive years (2007–2009).
      From nine foal crops, he sired <strong>five stakes winners</strong> and total progeny earnings of
      <strong>$1.8 million</strong>. He is out of a <strong>stakes-placed Nodouble mare</strong> and traces to the
      influential foundation mare <strong>Cool Mood</strong>.</p>

    <p>Her dam, <strong>Kimco Lady</strong>, though unplaced in one start, proved herself in the breeding shed
      as a <strong>stakes producer</strong> with <strong>11 foals to race, 9 winners</strong>, and progeny earnings of
      <strong>$666,089</strong>. The second dam, <strong>Great Nation</strong>, was a
      <strong>stakes winner and stakes-producing mare</strong>, with <strong>8 winners from 10 foals</strong> and
      progeny earnings of <strong>$439,654</strong>.</p>

    <p>This cross reinforces the proven <strong>Sadler’s Wells / Storm Cat</strong> pattern that has produced elite

    <p><strong>Her sire, Bold Executive</strong>, earned <strong>$365,305</strong> on the track and became a 
      <strong>Leading Canadian Sire</strong> in 2003 and 2004. He also achieved the remarkable feat of being the 
      <strong>Leading North American All-Weather Sire by Progeny Earnings (Sept. 2007)</strong> — surpassing even 
      <em>A.P. Indy</em> that year. Known for passing on his speed, strength, and heart, Bold Executive’s offspring have 
      succeeded at all levels of competition, making him a versatile sire of racehorses and sport prospects alike.</p>

    <p><strong>Tokyo Drifter’s dam line</strong> carries equal strength. Her dam sire, <strong>Rhythm</strong>, was sired 
      by <em>Mr. Prospector</em> out of <em>Dance Number</em>, a Grade I-winning daughter of <em>Northern Dancer</em>. 
      Rhythm’s exceptional career earned him the title of <strong>1989 U.S. Champion 2-Year-Old Colt</strong> with 
      lifetime earnings of <strong>$1,592,532</strong>. This family combines brilliance and refinement, producing both 
      soundness and the natural balance so valued in performance bloodlines.</p>

    <p><strong>Tokyo Drifter’s pedigree</strong> connects many of the great classic influences — 
      <em>Bold Ruler</em>, <em>Mr. Prospector</em>, and <em>Northern Dancer</em> — in a way that promotes 
      <strong>speed, versatility, and scope</strong>.</p>

    <p><strong>Tokyo Drifter</strong> combines the <em>Bold Ruler</em> and <em>Mr. Prospector</em> influences through her sire 
      <strong>Bold Executive</strong> and dam sire <strong>Rhythm</strong>, bringing proven lines of speed, athleticism, 
      and refinement. When paired with <strong>Without A Song</strong> (<em>Medaglia D’Oro – Serena’s Cat, by Storm Cat</em>), 
      the pedigree becomes exceptionally well-balanced — uniting the <strong>Sadler’s Wells / Storm Cat / Mr. Prospector / Northern Dancer</strong> 
      families that have shaped many of modern racing’s elite performers.</p>

    <p>This pairing mirrors the same powerful genetic patterns found in champions like <em>Songbird</em> and <em>Mshawish</em>, 
      both bred on the <strong>Medaglia D’Oro × Mr. Prospector-line</strong> cross. The result is an 
      <strong>A+ Nick Rating</strong>, recognized for producing foals with balance, class, and long-term athletic potential —
